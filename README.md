=============

Server side form validation FTW

### Basic usage

First require `biohzrdmx/validator-php` with Composer.

Then import the namespace, create a new `Validator` instance, add your validation rules and call the `validate` method:

```php
# Import namespace
use Validator\Validator;

# Create a validator instance and add some rules
$validator = Validator::newInstance()
	->addRule('name', $name)
	->addRule('email', $email, 'email')
	->addRule('password', $password)
	->addRule('confirm', $confirm, 'equal', $password)
	->validate();

# And check the result
if (! $validator->isValid() ) {
	$errors = $validator->getErrors();
	foreach ($errors as $error) {
		echo $error->message;
	}
}
```

The `isValid` method will return `false` if something isn't right and `true` if all your rules passed.

In case of failure you may call the `getErrors` method which will return an array of objects with a `name` and a `message` field so that you can inform the user why the validation failed.

#### Adding rules

To add a validation rule you must call the `addRule` method, which has the following signature:

```php
addRule($name, $value, $type = 'required', $opt = null) { ... }
```

The `$name` parameter identifies the rule and will be used for error reporting, while the `$value` refers to the variable you want to check.

`$opt` allows you to pass extra data, depending on the value of `$type`, which is explained below.

#### Rule types

You may specify any of the following built-in rule types for `$type`:

- `required` - A required field, the rule will fail if it is `null` or empty
- `email` - An email field, checked against W3C's regular expression for `email` fields in browsers
- `regex` - A field checked against a regular expression, pass the expression in `$opt`
- `equal` - A field that must be equal to another, pass the other field's value in `$opt`
- `checkboxes` - Intended for checkboxes, for the rule to succeed, its value must be a non-empty `array`
- `at least` - Intended for checkboxes, for the rule to succeed, its value must be a non-empty `array` with _at least n_ items inside. Pass the desired quantity in `$opt`
- `at most` - Intended for checkboxes, for the rule to succeed, its value must be an `array` with _at most n_ items inside. Pass the desired quantity in `$opt`

#### Custom rules

There are two ways of adding custom rules, the first and easiest is to just pass a `Closure` as the rule `opt`:

```php
$validator->addRule('Name', $name, 'custom', function($value) {
	# We do not accept Homers
	return $name != 'Homer';
});
```

The function receives the `$value` and must return `true` or `false` as the result of your validation, anything that is not `true` will make the rule fail.

This is recommended for one-off validation rules.

The second way is intended for validation rules that you will use in more than one place and/or require a complex logic. To do so, you will need to create a class that extends `Rule` and implements the `check` method:

```php
class CustomRule extends Rule {

	public function check() {
		$ret = $name != 'Homer';
		if (! $ret ) {
			$message = sprintf('We do not accept Homers');
			throw new ValidationException($this, $message);
		}
		return $ret;
	}
}
```

Note that you must throw a `ValidationException` when the validation fails AND return either `true` or `false` as in the above case.

Now that you've created your rule class, just pass its name as the rule type:

```php
$validator->addRule('Name', $name, CustomRule::class);
```

As you can see, custom validation classes provide more control as you may also specify a failure message.

You may also pass an extra `$opt` parameter that the rule will store in its own `$opt` member.
